# QR Instructions Professional UI Improvements

## Overview
Improved the QRInstructions component to provide a more professional customer experience and only display when there's an actual error or when customer action is required.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Smart Display Logic**
- **Before**: QRInstructions was shown even when the app was loading successfully
- **After**: Only shows when:
  - No URL parameters (customer needs to scan QR)
  - There's an actual error loading restaurant data
  - Loading failed after initialization

### 2. **Professional Error States**
- **Loading State**: Shows professional loading animation with spinner and clear messaging
- **Error State**: Displays specific error information with retry functionality
- **Failed State**: Handles cases where multiple retry attempts failed
- **Scan State**: Guides new customers to scan QR codes

### 3. **Enhanced UI/UX**
- **Material Design Icons**: Added proper icons for each state (loading, error, help)
- **Motion Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Professional Layout**: 
  - Clean white card design with proper shadows
  - Color-coded states (red for errors, blue for normal)
  - Better typography hierarchy
  - Responsive design

### 4. **Improved User Guidance**
- **Context-Aware Messages**: Different messages based on the current situation
- **Help Section**: Clear guidance on what customers should do
- **Professional Retry**: Better retry button with loading states
- **Staff Assistance**: Clear guidance to ask staff for help when needed

### 5. **Developer Experience**
- **Debug Mode**: QRDebugger only shows in development mode and when there's an error
- **Clean Code**: Separated concerns and improved readability
- **State Management**: Better state handling in OrderEaseApp
