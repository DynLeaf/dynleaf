# Table Status Double Counting Fix

## Issue Identified
The table status counts were showing incorrect totals because tables could be counted in multiple categories simultaneously. With 7 total tables, the system was showing:
- 7 Available + 5 Occupied = 12 total (impossible with only 7 tables)

## Root Cause
The original filtering logic allowed tables to satisfy multiple conditions:
```javascript
// Original problematic logic
Available: !currentOrder && !currentOrderId && !isOccupied && status !== 'reserved' && status !== 'maintenance'
Occupied: currentOrder || currentOrderId || isOccupied || status === 'occupied'
```

A table could be counted as both Available and Occupied if:
- `status: 'available'` (satisfies Available condition)
- `isOccupied: true` (satisfies Occupied condition)

## Solution Applied
Implemented **mutually exclusive priority-based counting** to ensure each table is counted in only one category:

### Priority Order:
1. **Occupied** (highest priority) - takes precedence over all other statuses
2. **Reserved** - only if not already counted as occupied
3. **Maintenance** - only if not already counted as occupied or reserved  
4. **Available** - all remaining tables

### New Logic:
```javascript
// Step 1: Find occupied tables (highest priority)
const occupiedTables = tables.filter(t => 
  t.currentOrder || t.currentOrderId || t.isOccupied || t.status === 'occupied'
);

// Step 2: Find reserved tables (excluding occupied)
const reservedTables = tables.filter(t => 
  t.status === 'reserved' && !occupiedTables.includes(t)
);

// Step 3: Find maintenance tables (excluding occupied and reserved)
const maintenanceTables = tables.filter(t => 
  t.status === 'maintenance' && !occupiedTables.includes(t) && !reservedTables.includes(t)
);

// Step 4: All remaining tables are available
const availableTables = tables.filter(t => 
  !occupiedTables.includes(t) && !reservedTables.includes(t) && !maintenanceTables.includes(t)
);
```

## Files Modified:
1. **`table.js`** - Updated the badge count display logic in the Table Management page
2. **`TableManagementWidget.js`** - Updated the tableStats calculation to use the same mutually exclusive logic

## Verification Added:
Added console logging to verify the counts:
```javascript
console.log('Verification - Total should equal sum:', {
  total: stats.total,
  sum: stats.occupied + stats.reserved + stats.maintenance + stats.available,
  matches: stats.total === (stats.occupied + stats.reserved + stats.maintenance + stats.available)
});
```

## Expected Result:
With 7 total tables, the counts should now be mutually exclusive and sum to exactly 7:
- Example: 2 Available + 5 Occupied + 0 Reserved + 0 Maintenance = 7 Total âœ…

## Benefits:
1. **Accurate Counts**: Each table counted exactly once
2. **Consistent Logic**: Same calculation method used across all components
3. **Priority System**: Clear precedence rules for conflicting statuses
4. **Debugging Support**: Console logs help verify calculations
5. **Mathematical Integrity**: Total always equals sum of all categories
