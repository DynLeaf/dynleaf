# Table Management Widget - Status Calculation Fix

## Issue Identified
The `tableStats` calculation in `TableManagementWidget.js` was not matching the logic used in the main Table Management page (`table.js`), causing inconsistent table status counts between the widget and the main table management interface.

## Root Cause
The widget was using a complex priority-based system with reservation time validation and custom logic, while the main Table Management page uses simpler, more direct filters based on specific table properties.

## Solution Applied
Updated the `tableStats` calculation to match **exactly** the same logic used in the main Table Management page:

### New Logic (Matching Table Management Page):

```javascript
// Available: tables with no current order, not occupied, and status is not reserved or maintenance
stats.available = tablesData.filter(t => 
  !t.currentOrder && 
  !t.currentOrderId && 
  !t.isOccupied && 
  t.status !== 'reserved' && 
  t.status !== 'maintenance'
).length;

// Occupied: tables with current order OR currentOrderId OR isOccupied flag OR status is 'occupied'
stats.occupied = tablesData.filter(t => 
  t.currentOrder || 
  t.currentOrderId || 
  t.isOccupied || 
  t.status === 'occupied'
).length;

// Reserved: tables with status 'reserved'
stats.reserved = tablesData.filter(t => 
  t.status === 'reserved'
).length;

// Maintenance: tables with status 'maintenance'
stats.maintenance = tablesData.filter(t => 
  t.status === 'maintenance'
).length;
```

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Removed Complex Priority Logic**: Eliminated the previous for-loop with priority-based status determination
2. **Removed Reservation Time Validation**: No longer checking if reservations are active within time ranges
3. **Simplified Status Checks**: Now directly checking table properties and status field
4. **Exact Filter Matching**: Using the identical filter logic from the main Table Management page

## Status Definitions (Now Consistent):

- **Available**: Tables that don't have current orders, aren't marked as occupied, and don't have 'reserved' or 'maintenance' status
- **Occupied**: Tables that have a current order reference, currentOrderId, isOccupied flag, or explicit 'occupied' status
- **Reserved**: Tables explicitly marked with 'reserved' status
- **Maintenance**: Tables explicitly marked with 'maintenance' status

## Benefits of This Fix:

1. **Consistency**: Widget now shows exactly the same counts as the main Table Management page
2. **Simplicity**: Cleaner, more maintainable code that directly mirrors the main interface
3. **Reliability**: No complex time-based calculations that could vary based on timing
4. **Performance**: Faster execution with simple filter operations instead of complex loops

## Files Modified:
- `d:\NodeJs\food-menu-order-managment\admin\src\components\Widgets\TableManagementWidget.js`

## Testing Verification:
The table counts in the widget should now match exactly with the counts shown in the main Table Management page badges:
- Available count should match the green "Available" badge
- Occupied count should match the red "Occupied" badge  
- Reserved count should match the yellow "Reserved" badge
- Maintenance count should match the gray "Maintenance" badge
